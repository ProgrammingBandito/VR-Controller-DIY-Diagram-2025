This is to show how the hardware is wired. It shows how I did it and you are free to experiment and try other methods.

Basically when you solder the wires to the Tactile Button Switches (you can use whatever two-pole switch you like), make sure wires are more than 10cm in length. Tie it down if it is too stringy. Better to have more than less.

Also the trigger button as shown in blue, you need to use a block ideally 3D printed to mount it inside the receiver. However feel free to experiment, I used a cork bottle opener initially and it worked as it allowed the protrusion of a m2 pin through it so it could stay secure inside the receiver. 

For the outside buttons, I only wired Grip and Menu button. For some reason Touchpad Press wasn't working. Will try again in the future. 
I highly recommend Gorilla Tack (DON'T use BLU-Tack) because it is very strong and doesn't lose its adhesion after a few sessions. 
If not, use the 3M double sided tape to mount it. Feel free to try anything else. 

This should go without saying but the wires need to be grounded (all Black wires), I used a jumper connector, feel free to try terminal blocks or soldering or even make your own PCB, go wild. 

Also please wire strip and expose a bit of wire for metallic conductive contact with the grub screws. Length of grub screws can vary, I recommend 6 to 8mm. That is what worked for me but you may need different lengths dependent on how one modifies the height of the tracker. 

As seen in the photos, the hardware is simplistic in design and function. The software is the real challenge.
Remember: 
1st refer to Ragesaq's(google his name with Reddit added in search, the guide was originally for Beat Saber wands) tracker role conversion guide. 
2nd, install the OpenVR IE with latest DLL update. 
3rd, test the Tracker input. 

Good luck and happy room clearing. 
Just in time for the VRO RoN mod.
